# How to run
Run it as you would run any C# .Net project and then simply enter the option you want to choose and the enter the path of the folder on the computer and the program will output its findings.

# About the app
The purpose of the code is mainly to list the large files in a folder and find duplicate files for help with clearing space. 
I made this as I needed a quick and easy to use tool for helping me decide how to clear space on my laptop and found file explorer and other methods far too slow.

The three options in the app are:
Find 10 largest files
List all files and their size, grouped by size
Find up to 20 duplicate files

This program was made was made with help from the C# .Net documentation from Microsoft at:
